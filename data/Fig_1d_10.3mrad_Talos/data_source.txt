## Usage

This folder organizes the *experimental 4D-STEM data* to provide out-of-the-box experience for people interested in trying the reconstruction. 
If you download this folder through my github (https://github.com/chiahao3/uncorrected_ptycho), the folders under `/data` should be empty due to file size limit on Github.
You would need to download the actual experimental data from our zenodo record (https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.7964153) 
Put the downloaded `scan_x128_y128.raw` into the corresponding folders and then you should be able to run reconstruction scripts from the main directory.

For example:
1. Download and unzip `Fig_01.zip`
2. Copy the `Fig_01/Panel_c-d_Talos/scan_x128_y128.raw`, and paste it to `data/Fig_1d_10.3mrad_Talos/`
3. Run reconstruction scripts `Fig_1d_10p3mrad_Talos_runPtycho.m`

# Notes of `data/`
-------------------------------

## Usage

This folder organizes the *experimental 4D-STEM data* to provide out-of-the-box experience for people interested in trying the reconstruction. 
If you download this folder through my github (https://github.com/chiahao3), the folders under `/data` should be empty due to file size limit on Github.
You would need to download the actual experimental data from our zenodo record (https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.7964153) 
Put the downloaded `scan_x128_y128.raw` into the corresponding folders and then you should be able to run reconstruction scripts from the main directory.

For example:
1. Download and unzip `Fig_01.zip`
2. Copy the `Fig_01/Panel_c-d_Talos/scan_x128_y128.raw`, and paste it to `data/Fig_1d_10.3mrad_Talos/`
3. Run reconstruction scripts `Fig_1d_10p3mrad_Talos_runPtycho.m`

## Metadata of the experimental data

### Instrument information
- Talos (Uncorrected)    : ThermoFisher Scientific Talos F200X G2 S/TEM  (https://mrl.illinois.edu/facilities/equipment/ThermoFisher-Scientific-TalosF200X-G2)
- Themis(Probe-corrected): FEI Themis Z Advanced Probe Aberration Corrected Analytical TEM/STEM  (https://mrl.illinois.edu/facilities/equipment/fei-themis-z-advanced-probe-aberration-corrected-analytical-temstem)
(Note that it was still `FEI` when we purchased the microscope in 2017-18)

### Fig. 1d Talos ptycho 10.3mrad
- Sample: tBL-WSe2
- Tool: Talos
- Experiment conditions: 200kV, 10.3mrad convegence angle, 98mm camera length, 20.5Mx, 0nm defocus (nominal), 19pA (nominal), 1ms dwell time, 128x130 CBED size (EMPAD1), 1.5066mrad dk, 128x128 scan steps, 0.5327 Ang scan step size

### Fig. 1h Themis ptycho 24.9mrad
- Sample: tBL-WSe2
- Tool: Themis
- Experiment conditions: 80kV, 24.9mrad convegence angle, 185mm camera length, 14.5Mx, 0nm defocus (nominal), 19pA (nominal), 1ms dwell time, 128x130 CBED size (EMPAD1), 2.1850mrad dk, 128x128 scan steps, 0.4285 Ang scan step size

### Fig. 2g Talos ptycho 7.5mrad
- Sample: tBL-WSe2
- Tool: Talos
- Experiment conditions: 200kV, 7.5mrad convegence angle, 98mm camera length, 20.5Mx, 0nm defocus (nominal), 19pA (nominal), 1ms dwell time, 128x130 CBED size (EMPAD1), 1.4701mrad dk, 128x128 scan steps, 0.5327 Ang scan step size

### Fig. 2h Talos ptycho 10.3mrad
- Sample: tBL-WSe2
- Tool: Talos
- Experiment conditions: 200kV, 10.3mrad convegence angle, 98mm camera length, 20.5Mx, 0nm defocus (nominal), 19pA (nominal), 1ms dwell time, 128x130 CBED size (EMPAD1), 1.5066mrad dk, 128x128 scan steps, 0.5327 Ang scan step size

### Fig. 2i Talos ptycho 23.1mrad 
- Sample: tBL-WSe2
- Tool: Talos
- Experiment conditions: 200kV, 23.1mrad convegence angle, 160mm camera length, 28.5Mx, 50nm underfocus (nominal), 1ms dwell time, 128x130 CBED size (EMPAD1), 0.9445mrad dk, 128x128 scan steps, 0.3920 Ang scan step size

Note that the input defocus for reconstruction is later calibrated in the script. 
Although errors in scan step size, convergence angle, and defocus value can all be compensated during the ptycho reconstruction, starting from a more accurate value helps the convergence.

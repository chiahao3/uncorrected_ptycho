% Introduction 
% •	This license agreement sets forth the terms and conditions under which the PAUL SCHERRER INSTITUT (PSI), CH-5232 Villigen-PSI, Switzerland (hereafter "LICENSOR") 
%   will grant you (hereafter "LICENSEE") a royalty-free, non-exclusive license for academic, non-commercial purposes only (hereafter "LICENSE") to use the cSAXS 
%   ptychography MATLAB package computer software program and associated documentation furnished hereunder (hereafter "PROGRAM").
%
% Terms and Conditions of the LICENSE
% 1.	LICENSOR grants to LICENSEE a royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use the PROGRAM for academic, non-commercial purposes, upon the terms and conditions 
%       hereinafter set out and until termination of this license as set forth below.
% 2.	LICENSEE acknowledges that the PROGRAM is a research tool still in the development stage. The PROGRAM is provided without any related services, improvements 
%       or warranties from LICENSOR and that the LICENSE is entered into in order to enable others to utilize the PROGRAM in their academic activities. It is the 
%       LICENSEE’s responsibility to ensure its proper use and the correctness of the results.”
% 3.	THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR

%       OF THE PROGRAM OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE PROGRAM.
% 4.	LICENSEE agrees that it will use the PROGRAM and any modifications, improvements, or derivatives of PROGRAM that LICENSEE may create (collectively, 
%       "IMPROVEMENTS") solely for academic, non-commercial purposes and that any copy of PROGRAM or derivatives thereof shall be distributed only under the same 
%       license as PROGRAM. The terms "academic, non-commercial", as used in this Agreement, mean academic or other scholarly research which (a) is not undertaken for 
%       profit, or (b) is not intended to produce works, services, or data for commercial use, or (c) is neither conducted, nor funded, by a person or an entity engaged 
%       in the commercial use, application or exploitation of works similar to the PROGRAM.
% 5.	LICENSEE agrees that it shall make the following acknowledgement in any publication resulting from the use of the PROGRAM or any translation of the code into 
%       another computing language:
%       "Data processing was carried out using the cSAXS ptychography MATLAB package developed by the Science IT and the coherent X-ray scattering (CXS) groups, Paul

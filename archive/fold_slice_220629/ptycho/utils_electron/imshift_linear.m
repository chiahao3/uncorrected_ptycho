% IMSHIFT_LINEAR  will apply shift that can be different for 
%     each frame.  
%     + compared to imshift_fft, it does not have periodic boundary 
%     + it is based on linear interpolation, so it can be run fast on GPU 
%     + integer shift is equivalent to imshift_fft (up to the boundary condition)
%     - it needs for-loop for each frame -> it gets slow on GPU for
%       shifting my small images. In that case imshift_fft can be faster. 
%
%   img = imshift_linear(img, x,y, method)
%
%   Inputs:
%       **img   input image / stack of images 
%       **x     applied shift or vector of shifts for each frame 
%       **y     applied shift or vector of shifts for each frame 
%       **method choose interpolation method: nearest, {linear}, cubic , circ
% 
%   *returns*: 
%       ++img  shifted image / stack of images

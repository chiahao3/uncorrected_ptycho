# fold_slice

This is Yi Jiang's customized code for X-ray/electron ptychography and tomography/laminography.

The package is built upon the Matlab code developed by the Science IT and the coherent X-ray scattering (CXS) groups at Paul Scherrer Institut, Switzerland:
https://www.psi.ch/en/sls/csaxs/software. Copyright and license issues should follow the agreements (see below) and/or refer to their website.

# Get started
1. Check the official [documentation](https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600576720001776) of the PtychoShelves package to see its requirements. You need the following Matlab toolbox to use all the features: Parallel computing, Curve Fitting, Image processing, Optimization, and Signal processing.

2. For ptychography, try the data preparation and reconstruction scripts in /fold_slice/ptycho/examples to get familiar with the data format and reconstruction parameters.

# Resources
1. A customized [foldsliceGPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-YKQKluCy9-foldslicegpt) that serves as an AI expert in X-ray and electron ptychography. It can help users with various tasks such as designing experiments and preparing reconstruction scripts.
2. The files in /fold_slice/ptycho/notes/ could help you understand the overall code structure. Warning: some notes might be outdated.
3. [Dr. Chia-Hao Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/chiahao-lee/home?pli=1) wrote a great [blog](https://chiahao-blog.super.site/posts/theory-algorithm-and-code-structure-of-ptychoshelves) that details the algorithms and code structure of PtychoShelves.
4. We have a weekly study group to discuss novel computational imaging techniques in electron microscopy. Some tutorial lectures can be found [here](https://anl.box.com/s/f7lk410lf62rnia70fztd5l7n567btyv).

# Major differences from the PtychoShelves package
1. Some data and reconstruction I/O conventions have been changed to accommodate for electron ptychography. See the example scripts for more details.

2. A modified least-squares maximum likelihood multi-slice ptychography algorithm is added as a new engine: GPU_MS

It's based on the GPU engine (written by Michal Odstrcil) with improvements such as multiple probe modes and bug fixes. Usage of the code should include additional citations:

Z. Chen, Y. Jiang, Y. Shao, M. E. Holtz, M. Odstrčil, M. Guizar-Sicairos, I. Hanke, S. Ganschow, D. G. Schlom, D. A. Muller, Electron ptychography achieves atomic-resolution limits set by lattice vibrations. Science 372 (6544), 826-831.

3. We developed an automatic parameter tuning workflow for ptychography using Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-16041-5. See the example scripts for more details.

4. A non-exhaustive list of new features in the GPU and GPU_MS engines: 

| Features  | GPU         |  GPU_MS | 
| :---         |     :---:      |  :---: |
| Mixed-states + multislice ptychography  | :heavy_multiplication_x:  | :heavy_check_mark:  |

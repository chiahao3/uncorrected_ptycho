% SET_VIEWS Reduce stack of projections into one shared object 
%
% object = set_views(object, object_update, layer,object_id, indices, cache, scan_ids, skip_ind)
%
% ** obj_update [Nx_o, Ny_o] array or cells containing object 
% ** obj_proj   [Nx_p, Ny_p, N] preallocated array for the views
% ** layer_ids  id of the solved layer for multilayer ptycho 
% ** object_id  id of the object, ie scan or incoherent mode 
% ** indices   processed positions 
% ** cache     structure with precalculated values to avoid unnecessary overhead
% ** scan_ids   determines to which scan correponds each of the position 
% ** skip_ind   list of indices to be skipped

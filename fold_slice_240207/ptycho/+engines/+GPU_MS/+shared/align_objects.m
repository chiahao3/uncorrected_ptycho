% Introduction 
% •	This license agreement sets forth the terms and conditions under which the PAUL SCHERRER INSTITUT (PSI), CH-5232 Villigen-PSI, Switzerland (hereafter "LICENSOR") 
%   will grant you (hereafter "LICENSEE") a royalty-free, non-exclusive license for academic, non-commercial purposes only (hereafter "LICENSE") to use the cSAXS

%
% Terms and Conditions of the LICENSE
% 1.	LICENSOR grants to LICENSEE a royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use the PROGRAM for academic, non-commercial purposes, upon the terms and conditions

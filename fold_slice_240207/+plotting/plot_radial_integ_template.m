'NewFig',1,...              open a new figure for each file, default is 0
'ClearFig',0,...            clear the figure before plotting, default is 1
'XLog',1,...                logarithmic scaling of the x-axis, default is 0
'YLog',1,...                logarithmic scaling of the y-axis, default is 1
'PlotQ',0,...               plot as a function of momentum transfer q rather than pixel no., default is 0
'PlotAngle',0,...           plot as a function of the azimuthal angle rather than q or the radius, default is 0
'RadiusRange',[],...        for azimuthal plots the intensity over this radius range is averaged, default is [] for all radii
'QMulPow',[],...        multiply intensity with q to the power of this value, default is [ ] for no multiplication
'Inverse_nm',1,...          plot q in inverse nm rather than inverse Angstroem, default is 0

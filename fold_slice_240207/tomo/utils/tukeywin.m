function w = tukeywin(n,r)
%TUKEYWIN Tukey window.
%   TUKEYWIN(N) returns an N-point Tukey window in a column vector.
% 
%   W = TUKEYWIN(N,R) returns an N-point Tukey window in a column vector. A
%   Tukey window is also known as the cosine-tapered window.  The R
%   parameter specifies the ratio of the length of taper section to the
%   total length of the window. For a Tukey window, R is normalized to 1
%   (i.e., 0 < R < 1). If omitted, R is set to 0.500.
%   
%   If R is outside the region of (0, 1), the Tukey window degenerates into
%   other common windows. Thus when R = 1, it is equivalent to a Hanning
%   window. Conversely, for R = 0 the Tukey window is equivalent to a
%   boxcar window.
%
%   EXAMPLE:
%      N = 64; 
%      w = tukeywin(N,0.5); 
%      plot(w); title('64-point Tukey window, Ratio = 0.5');

% Append the varible to the file
% function save_append(filename,  vars, x)
%
% Input:
% filename - file to which the varible will be appended
% vars - the varible to save, eg, saveme
% x - the string of the variable name, eg, 'saveme'
%
% Note:
% This is a temporary solution because either
% 'save' nor 'vars=evalin('caller', varargin{1})' 
% works for parfor..

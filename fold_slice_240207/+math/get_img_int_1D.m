% GET_IMG_INT_1 use FFT to integate the image along selected axis -> can be used for phase
% unwrapping
%
%   integer = get_img_int_1D(grad_array, ax)
%
% Inputs:
%   **grad_array   -  phase gradient
%   **ax           -  integration axis 
% *returns*
%   ++integral - 2D stack scalar arrays that has gradients along "ax" close to "grad_array"

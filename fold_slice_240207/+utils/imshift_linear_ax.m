% IMSHIFT_LINEAR_AX  will apply shift that can be different for 
%     each frame along axis ax   
%     + compared to imshift_fft, it does not have periodic boundary 
%     + it is based on linear interpolation, so it can be run fast on GPU 
%     + integer shift is equivalent to imshift_fft (up to the boundary condition)
%     - it needs for-loop for each frame -> it gets slow on GPU for
%       shifting my small images. In that case imshift_fft can be faster. 
%
%   img = imshift_linear(img, x,y, method)
%
%   Inputs:
%       **img       input image / stack of images 
%       **shift     applied shift or vector of shifts for each frame 
%       **ax        axis along which the shift will be performed 
%       **method    choose interpolation method: nearest, {linear}, cubic , circ
%       **extrap_val filling value for the missing regions after interpolation (default=nan)
% 
%   returns: 
%       ++img        shifted image / stack of images
